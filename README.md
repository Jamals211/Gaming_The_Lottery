This is a study about predicting winning lottery numbers. The Mega Millions dates back to 1996 when it was called the Big Game. Winning Numbers are drawn twice a week and tickets are $2. Five numbers are drawn from a pool of 1-70 white balls and one number is drawn from 1-25 gold balls. You can choose the numbers yourself or you can use a Quick Pick and let the computer generate random numbers.<p>
There are nine ways to win that include picking the correct gold ball and getting $2 to guessing all five white balls and the gold ball which will net you the jackpot. <p>
